# ColorPlot
Color Plot visualization tool made by David Kohler, designed for Python 3.6. Allows user to plot the color
distribution of any painting or image in a 3D scatter plot style, using Plotly. Selects a sample number of pixels
to maximize efficiency and visualization. Contains Starry Night, Mona Lisa, Girl with a Pearl Earring, and Van
Gogh's Self Portrait as default images to use (although any image added would work).
Also allows for plotting on various color spaces including RGB, HSL, HSV, HWB, CMY, XYZ, and CIE L*a*b* for increased
functionality. Visit my website to view examples of the plots. Designed for use from the terminal.
